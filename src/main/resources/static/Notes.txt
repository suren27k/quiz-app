What happened?

1. Create a table in DB for storing questions.
2. Using some open source API, gather questions and manually insert them in DB.
3. Create CRUD operation for questions.
4. Create quiz
	1. No need to manually create quiz table and mapping table in DB. They will be auto-created in the next run of the
	   application when we create the entities and add the required annotations like @ManyToMany, @Entity, etc.

	   Note: We do not have to manually create these tables. We just code in the entities and they are auto created
	   in the next run of the application.

	2. This part is a bit tricky. See how the SQL works in @Query annotation in QuizService. Also look at @ManyToMany.
		1. In the SQL query, we use colon operator to mention outside variables of java within it.
		2. What is nativeQuery here?
	3. One table is quiz table. The second is a mapping table for mapping quiz and questions.
	4. Why 2 tables were created? Because this is a many-many mapping.
	5. Why is this not a one-many mapping? One quiz has many questions right?
		1. When deciding between the 4 mappings : one-one, one-many, many-one, many-many, always think from both
			side. Does one quiz have many questions? Can one question be on many quiz?
		2. Since answer is yes to both questions, we have many-many mapping here.


Fetching a quiz
1. Instead of returning a quiz object, we return only the list of questions.
2. We do not need to include the correct answer, difficulty, category in this request.
3. So, we create a new entity QuestionWrapper without those fields.
4. In QuizService, we get the quiz and store it in Optional - otherwise compiler error because Dao might return null if
   no entry is found in the DB for the given ID.
5. Now, we manually copy all required fields from fetcher Questions to QuestionWrappers.


Submitting quiz and evaluating the score (/submit)
1. Instead of checking if chosen option is correct answer or not, check if the value of chosen option is same as the
    value of correct answer.
2. The id of question if going to be in the path and the responses to each question will in the request body - so here,
    we have @PathVariable and @ResponseBody for the same function in the arguments list.
3. We have to create a new class QuizResponse for ORM of the responses sent to server. We use @RequiredArgsConstructor
    to make both default and all params constructor available through lombok.
4. Calculating quiz score is business logic - so we do it in service layer.

Converting to Microservices
1. Must makes separate the app into QuizService and QuestionService (not the classes in service layer but microservices).
2. QuizService must talk to QuestionService via HTTP/REST request to create a quiz.
3. QuizService must again talk to QuestionService to evaluate the result of a quiz.
4. If we have both as separate services, then they will likely be replicated in multiple servers. How do we find the
    IP addresses? How we select which server must also depend on load balancing.
5. So, we need an API gateway with maybe a service discovery/registry service.
6. What if question service is down when quiz service wants to talk to it? We have to do "failed fast" - which is used
    to tell the client that a service is not responding so that the client can explore alternative options. Here, the
    client is Quiz Service. Circuit breaker!
7. Every microservice is a separate project in the IDE!
